		[Y] Has strategy classes for Human, Greedy and Random Player  
		
	Factory   2 / 2
		Constructing the different strategies

		[Y] There exists a factory class, with a method similar to createProduct(String s).

	Command   2 / 2
		Objectifying moves

		[Y] Command or Moves are objects.
		[Y] There command/move objects are stored in a list in Othello.
		
	Visitor   3 / 4
		Using visitors to visit places on the board
		
		[Y] There is a base class Visitor.
		[N] OthelloBoard has an 'accept(Visitor v)'.
		[Y] Each visitor class has a 'visit(OthelloBoard b)' method. 
		[Y] There are at least two separate visitors, e.g., MoveVisitor and HashMoveVisitor.
	
sprintBacklogs   1 / 4
	[N] User stories in springBacklog1 has all/majority of Status, Priorities, Estimates, Owners for user stories and Issues clearly defined
	[N] User stories in springBacklog2 has all/majority of Status, Priorities, Estimates, Owners for user stories and Issues clearly defined
	[Y] User stories in springBacklog3 has all/majority of Status, Priorities, Estimates, Owners for user stories and Issues clearly defined
	[N] User stories in springBacklog4 has all/majority of Status, Priorities, Estimates, Owners for user stories and Issues clearly defined

Git   0 / 4
	[N] Branches on user stories (With reasonable naming convention)
	[N] No/little code commits on master
	[N] Merges back to master
	[N] Git history looks relatively straightforward

Members: Each member is given a fraction of the total amount of work
	for the project. This is based on the user stories they worked on.
	If all members appeared to work the same amount, each gets 25%.
	If all members contribute equally, each gets 25/100.

FINAL MARK FOR A2:
chenj628: 30.74072798549033313524 / 40
salehosa: 26.81873361976400543549 / 40
watso166: 35.13403925279847984785 / 40
wronadom: 29.17432229871973657135 / 40

---------------------------------
HOW THE FINAL MARK IS CALCULATED:

group_mark = DOCUMENTATION + CODING STYLE + GUI FUNCTIONALITY + ARCHITECTURE + SPRINT BACKLOGS + GIT

individual_mark = (WORK BY UTORID + 10 * DailyScrum) * 100 / 110

final_grade = group_mark * (A ln(individual_mark + 1) + B) + C

where:
A = 0.29734
B = 0.0070976
C = 2

The values of A, B, C are chosen so that:
- if WORK BY UTORID is close to 0, then the student gets close to 0% of the group mark
- if WORK BY UTORID is close to 25%, then the student gets close to 100% of the group mark
- a WORK BY INDIVIDUAL of 100% led to a maximum of 105% over all students.
- The average adjusted mark is similar to the average of the unadjusted marks, so marks are approximately conserved.

NOTES: 
- why did you remove starter code like PlayerGreedy or PlayerHuman?
- naming convention for branches is not consistent (e.g. remotes/origin/UserStory1.08, remotes/origin/new_US1.12, remotes/origin/US1.11) 
- Donâ€™t branch of branches and then merge back to branch. Should be branching off master and then merge back to master
- for springBacklog1/2/4 missing owner, priority, or estimate
- remove uncommented code for cleaner code (lost marks for coding style)
