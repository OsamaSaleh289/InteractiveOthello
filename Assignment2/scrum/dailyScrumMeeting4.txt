Oct 30,2019
	What I did yesterday: First day with new group. 
	What I will do today: Finish US1.04 and US1.05. Review group members' code and get up to date 
	with what has been accomplished so far
	Obstacles I face: Getting accustomed to the observable/observer design pattern

Oct 31,2019
	What I did yesterday: Finished US1.04. Reviewed group code and understand the observable patterns used
	What I will do today: Get more accustomed to branching and debug some errors in US1.04. Went to office
	hours and fully understood how it works. Start US1.05. Study for the test rest of the day.
	Obstacles I face: I lost some code today due to a misunderstaniding of branching. Still need to 
	practice using it more. 

Nov 1,2019
	What I did yesterday: Debugged US1.04 and fully understood branching. Also started US1.05.
	What I will do today: Finish US1.05 and make US1.04 work for other scenarios (HumanVSRandom etc...). 
	Also fix some issues with my repo
	Obstacles I face: Facing challenges with getting US1.04 and US1.05 work for HumanVSRandom strategy
	but will hopefully get it done.

Nov 2,2019
	What I did yesterday: I realized US1.08 still needs to be done before I can finish this portion so 
	I worked on other material instead. 
	What I will do today: Study for 2 tests this coming week until the rest of the sprint is done.
	Obstacles I face: No major ones as of yet.

Nov 3,2019
	What I did yesterday: Worked mostly on other course material.
	What I will do today: Do the 207 readings for the lecture this upcoming Monday and continiue studying
	for next week's test. Go over the next user stories and understand whats required in prepration for the next
	scrum meeting.
	Obstacles I face: No major obstacles.

Nov 4,2019
	What I did yesterday: Not much on the assignment. We were all waiting to catch up so everyone is on
	track with the second sprint
	What I will do today: Was sick so couldn't conduct scrum meeting but agreed on which user stories 
	to finish by the time we are done the 3rd sprint
	Obstacles I face: Need to manage time and multitask better

Nov 5,2019
	What I did yesterday: Studied for upcoming tests and assignment due dates since I was at home all day
	and couldn't conduct scrum meeting
	What I will do today: Conduct scrum meeting and assign tasks
	Obstacles I face: No major obstacles

Nov 6,2019
	What I did yesterday: Assigned user stories via scrum meeting. 
	What I will do today: Fully understand whats required and brainstorm ways of implementing proper
	design patterns to implement my user stories. I was assigned 1.11 and 1.13.
	Obstacles I face: I've done something similar to the animation in an android app before
	so I should be able to do it. Restarting might need a little bit more thinking since you need to 
	know exactly which tokens to reset.

Nov 7,2019
	What I did yesterday: Brainstormed some solutions to implement my user stories.
	What I will do today: Final round of studying for the 2 tests I have today.
	Obstacles I face: No major obstacles.

Nov 8,2019
	What I did yesterday: Started US1.13 and finished studying for my tests.
	What I will do today: Finish US1.11. Expecting US1.11 to take a little bit more time.
	Obstacles I face: Not really sure what US1.13 is asking

Nov 9,2019
	What I did yesterday: Spent most of the time researching animations in JavaFX and how to implement them.
	What I will do today: Finish US1.11 since I didn't get to work on it much
	Obstacles I face: Using animations

Nov 10,2019
	What I did yesterday: Finished US1.11 and now I fully understand what US1.13 is asking
	(I posted on the discussion board).
	What I will do today: Work more on US1.13. Brainstorm how I want to implement the animation
	Obstacles I face: Figuring out exactly how I'm going to present my animation

Nov 11,2019
	What I did yesterday: Struggling to figure out ways to implement US1.13 using MVC. I figured out
	the animation I want though and will confirm it in office hours.
	What I will do today: Confirm animation I want in office hours. Figure out different strategies to implement the animation using MVC. I'm 
	trying to imlement a fading animation which colors the boxes that were changed and the color 
	then fades away.
	Obstacles I face: Implementing the description above using MVC.

Nov 12,2019
	What I did yesterday: Confirmed my animation in office hours and tired different ways of implementation
	but few corresponded to an MVC pattern
	What I will do today: I figured out a strategy to implement this user story based on saving the token
	value in the observer for each board square and checking if it changes. I will try implmenting it 
	that way
	Obstacles I face: Getting the board to reset the colour after the animation. 

Nov 13,2019
	What I did yesterday: I got the animation to work its just that the coloured squares do not 
	reset after the next move.
	What I will do today: Will try and fix that issue and make the colours reset after every move
	Obstacles I face: Reseting the animation

Nov 14,2019
	What I did yesterday: Tried different ways of getting the animation to reset but was unsuccessful
	What I will do today: Get the animated boxes to reset and assign a differnet animation colour to 
	each player
	Obstacles I face: Combining the observer design pattern with the animation implmentation

Nov 15,2019
	What I did yesterday: Succcessfully completed the animation
	What I will do today: Work on understanding the visitor design pattern
	Obstacles I face: Implmenting US1.17 is a bit confusing

Nov 16,2019
	What I did yesterday: Fully understood the visitor pattern
	What I will do today: Fix some issues with animations with help from our partner Katrina and 
	finish US1.17
	Obstacles I face: Fully grasping how to implment the visitor design pattern. Should overcome it though.
