watso166 / Katrina Watson:

I didn't realize we had to configure our branches for upstream at first 
so I think there's at least one branch where I didn't do that and 
possibly others where I forgot since the website you linked us to 
that explained the process didn't say to do that.

Also, I didn't know you would be looking for individual branches for 
each user story/bug so if it made sense (ie. the user stories/bugs
were closely related or the bug came up while doing the user story) 
then I did them all on that one branch. I'm pretty sure I still made
all major changes on a branch though.
